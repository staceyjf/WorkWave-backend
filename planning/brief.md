# Employee Creator
## Introduction
Your first step in the recruitment process is to demonstrate your understanding of writing RESTful APIs in Java and frontend using React Typescript.

When writing your code, please be mindful of the following:

1. Your code should be production ready.
2. Your code should be understandable and maintainable by other developers.
3. Your code should be robust and handle error situations.
4. Your code should be bug free, compile and work. Please include instructions to compile and run the API and the Web app in localhost. Hosting (Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc.) is required.
5. If your code includes unit tests you may use a unit test framework of your choice.

The requirement
We need a web application to create, list, modify and delete employees. The application should consist of a spring RESTful API and a React Typescript frontend. The schema for the employee is left to the criteria of the candidate.

React hints:
- React Redux is recommended.
- Typescript is recommended.
- React hooks are recommended.
- React create app is a good starting point.
- You can include any other open source NPM library.
- Feel free to use your favorite CSS framework.
- Feel free to use your favorite middleware.
- Add some basic validations on the form like required and max length validations.
- The site should be responsive.

RESTful API hints:
- The list can be a local database, CSV, TXT file or even in memory
- Implementing an API logging strategy.
- Implementing error handling strategy.

At least 3 endpoints are required:
- To create an employee
- To get a list of existing employees
- To delete an employee

### Frontend
- Vite with react-ts
- Use SCSS instead of CSS, npm install sass
- Use React Query for API calls

- React Form Hook for form validation & submission
- https://react-hook-form.com/get-started
- Use HTML attributes to required / validate fields before writing your own validation
- Typescript React Cheatsheet
